C++ STL
STL refers to Standard Template Library

if We want to sort array.
So we can write code from scratch or We can use STL Sort inbuild function.

**STL Comes in 4 Parts**
-> Containers
-> Iterators
-> Algorithms
-> Functors

--Containers--
1. Vector {Dynamic Memory Allocation, Resize at Runtime}:
vector<int> vec;
vector<int> vec = {1,2};
vector<int> vec(3,10);
vector<int> vec2(vec1);

---> Functions of Vectors (TC = O(1)):
-> size & capacity
-> push_back & pop_back
-> emplace_back
-> at() , or we can use "[]"
-> front & back        {first & last element of vector}

---> Costly Function (TC = O(n))
-> erase        (use to erase an element from vector, by passing the Iterator) also erase a range. {function changes size of vec, not capacity}
-> insert       (to insert an element at specific position){vec.insert(pos, val)}
-> clear
-> empty        (check the vector is empty or not)

--Iterators--           {Imagine it like a Pointer}
-> vec.begin()          {return iterator which is pointing to exactly in Memory}
-> vec.end()
