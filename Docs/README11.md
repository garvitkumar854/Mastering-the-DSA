# 11. Majority Element

## 🧠 Problem Statement

You are given an array of size `n`. Your task is to **find the element that appears more than ⌊n / 2⌋ times** (i.e., the majority element).

- If such an element exists, return it.
- If no majority element exists, return `-1`.

## 📥 Example

### ✅ Example 1:
```
Input: [2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2]
Output: 2
```
**Explanation**: 2 appears 5 times in an array of size 7 → ⌊7/2⌋ = 3. So 2 is the majority element ✅

### ❌ Example 2 (No Majority):
```
Input:  [1, 2, 3, 4]
Output: -1
```
**Explanation**: No element appears more than 2 times ❌

## 📌 Constraints

- Array size `n ≥ 1`
- Elements can be any integers
- Goal is to solve in optimal time (O(n)) and space (O(1)) if possible
