# 29. STL (Standard Template Library)

The **Standard Template Library (STL)** is a powerful set of C++ template classes to provide common data structures and algorithms. It includes containers like vectors, lists, stacks, queues, maps, and algorithms like sorting, searching, and more.

STL makes programming more efficient by offering reusable, well-tested, and optimized data structures and functions.

## ðŸ§  Learnings

- Understand **sequence containers** (vector, list, deque)
- Learn **associative containers** (set, map, multimap, unordered_map)
- Use **container adaptors** (stack, queue, priority_queue)
- Apply powerful **algorithms** from `<algorithm>` for sorting, searching, reversing, and permutations
- Use **pairs** and **iterators** effectively
- Difference between `map`, `unordered_map`, `multimap`, and their usage
- Master `__builtin_popcount` functions for bit counting in competitive programming
