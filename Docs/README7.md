# 7. Arrays

Arrays are one of the most essential and foundational data structures in programming. They allow storing **multiple elements of the same type** in a contiguous block of memory under a single variable name.

### 🧠 Key Concepts You'll Learn:
- **Array Initialization & Access** — Understand how to declare, define, and access elements using indices.
- **Pass by Reference** — Improve memory efficiency by passing the array's address to functions.
- **Linear Search** — Learn the most basic searching technique used to find elements sequentially.
- **In-Place Reversal** — Efficiently reverse arrays by swapping elements using two pointers.
- **Additional Techniques** — Practice insertion, deletion, traversal, and boundary-based logic for problem-solving.

Mastering arrays sets the stage for solving problems in strings, matrices, sorting, searching, and more advanced data structures like linked lists, heaps, and trees.
