# 7. Arrays

The Arrays folder introduces the fundamental concept of arrays, which are used to store multiple elements of the same type in a single variable. This section covers the Introduction to Arrays, explaining their structure and usage in programming. You'll learn how to manipulate arrays through techniques like Pass by Reference, which allows functions to modify the original array, improving efficiency. The Linear Search Algorithm will be covered, demonstrating how to search for an element in an array sequentially. Additionally, you'll explore how to Reverse an Array by swapping elements in place, along with other important array operations like insertion, deletion, and traversal. Mastering arrays is vital for solving complex problems, as they form the basis for more advanced data structures.
