# 8. Vectors

A Vector is a dynamic array provided by the C++ Standard Template Library (STL). Unlike regular arrays, vectors can grow and shrink in size automatically when elements are added or removed.
Itâ€™s like an expandable array that manages memory on its own.

ðŸ”‘ Key Features:
- Dynamic size â€“ No need to specify size in advance.
- Random access â€“ Just like arrays, you can access elements using an index.
- STL-powered â€“ Comes with many built-in functions (like push_back, pop_back, size, etc.).
- Efficient â€“ Memory and performance optimized for many use cases.
