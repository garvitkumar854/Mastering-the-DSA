# 8. Vectors

Vectors are dynamic arrays provided by the **C++ Standard Template Library (STL)**. Unlike regular arrays, vectors automatically resize when elements are added or removed, making them ideal for flexible and scalable data storage.

### 🧠 Key Concepts You'll Learn:
- ✅ **Dynamic Sizing** — No need to predefine the size; vectors expand or shrink as needed.
- 📌 **STL Functions** — Learn built-in methods like `push_back`, `pop_back`, `size`, `clear`, and more.
- 🔁 **Random Access** — Access elements in constant time using indices.
- ⚙️ **Efficient Memory Management** — STL handles memory allocation and deallocation behind the scenes.
- 🚀 **Real Use Cases** — Widely used in coding competitions, interviews, and real-world applications.

Vectors combine the power of arrays with the flexibility of modern containers — a must-know for any aspiring C++ programmer.
