# 17. Pointers

Pointers are one of the most powerful features in C++. They allow direct memory access and manipulation, which is critical in system programming, dynamic memory handling, and performance-sensitive applications.

This folder dives deep into:
- Basics of pointers
- Pointer to pointer
- Pass by reference using pointers and references
- Array-pointer relationships
- Pointer arithmetic

These concepts are essential for mastering memory-level programming and understanding how data structures like arrays, linked lists, and trees are implemented under the hood.
