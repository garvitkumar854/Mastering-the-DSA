# 3. Patterns

This folder focuses on the **art of pattern generation**, a creative and logical way to strengthen your programming fundamentals using nested loops and conditional statements.

Patterns are printed using characters like `*`, numbers, or spaces — and are a great exercise for mastering:
- Loop control (nested `for`/`while`)
- Space and character alignment
- Logical conditions for structure and symmetry

By practicing patterns like **triangles**, **pyramids**, **diamonds**, and **Floyd’s triangle**, you'll gain confidence in **loop nesting**, which is critical for writing clear and efficient logic — especially in interviews and early coding rounds.
