# 3. Patterns

The Patterns folder introduces the concept of pattern generation, which involves printing various shapes and designs using loops. These patterns, often made up of stars (*), numbers, or other characters, serve as a great way to practice and enhance your understanding of loops and logic. You'll explore different types of patterns such as right-angled triangles, pyramids, diamond shapes, and number patterns. Understanding how to generate these patterns helps improve your skills in controlling loop structures and reinforces the application of conditional statements. This topic is a practical way to strengthen your problem-solving abilities, which is essential for mastering algorithms and preparing for competitive programming challenges.
