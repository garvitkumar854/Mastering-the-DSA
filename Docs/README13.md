# 13. Power Exponential Problem

## 🧠 Problem Statement

You are given two integers `a` and `b`. Your task is to calculate `a^b` (i.e., **a raised to the power b**) efficiently.

The goal is to implement this with optimized time complexity using the **Binary Exponentiation** (also called **Exponentiation by Squaring**) technique.

## 📥 Example

### ✅ Example 1:
```
Input: a = 2, b = 10
Output: 1024
```
**Explanation:** 2 raised to the power 10 is 1024 → 2^10 = 1024 ✅

### ❌ Example 2:
```
Input: a = 3, b = 0
Output: 1
```
**Explanation:** Any number to the power 0 is always 1 ❌

## 📌 Constraints

- `0 ≤ a ≤ 10^5`
- `0 ≤ b ≤ 10^9`
- Try to solve in **O(log b)** time using Binary Exponentiation
