# 5. Binary Number System

This folder introduces the **Binary Number System**, the core of digital computation. In binary, only two digits â€” `0` and `1` â€” are used to represent all numbers and perform operations. Every bit of data your computer processes relies on binary logic.

You'll learn:
- The structure and significance of binary numbers
- How to convert between **binary â†” decimal**
- Binary arithmetic used in programming and low-level hardware
- Why understanding binary is essential for memory management, bitwise operations, and performance optimization
