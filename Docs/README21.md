# 21. Single Element in Sorted Array

## 🧠 Problem Statement

You are given a **sorted array** `arr[]` in which every element appears **exactly twice**, except for one element that appears only **once**.

Your task is to find and return that **single non-duplicate element** using an efficient approach.

You must solve this in **O(log n)** time and **O(1)** space.

## 📥 Example

### ✅ Example 1:
```
Input: arr = [1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5, 5]
Output: 3
```
**Explanation:** Only 3 appears once; every other number appears twice ✅

### ❌ Example 2:
```
Input: arr = [0, 0, 1]
Output: 1
```
**Explanation:** 1 is the only single element ❌

## 📌 Constraints

- `1 ≤ arr.length ≤ 10^5`
- `arr.length` is **odd**
- All elements are integers and the array is **sorted**
- Solve in **O(log n)** time using Binary Search
