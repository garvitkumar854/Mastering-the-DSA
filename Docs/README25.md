# 25. Sorting Algorithms

Sorting is a fundamental concept in Data Structures and Algorithms, used to arrange elements in a specific order (ascending or descending). Efficient sorting plays a critical role in optimizing search operations and improving algorithm performance.

This folder covers the three most basic and widely used comparison-based sorting algorithms. Each algorithm helps build a strong understanding of loop structures, time complexity, and in-place operations.

### ðŸ“˜ Concept Files

- [Bubble Sort](/25_Sorting_Algorithms/01.cpp)  
  âž¤ Repeatedly swaps adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order. Simple, but not very efficient. Time: O(nÂ²)

- [Selection Sort](/25_Sorting_Algorithms/02.cpp)  
  âž¤ Selects the minimum element from the unsorted part and moves it to the beginning. Time: O(nÂ²)

- [Insertion Sort](/25_Sorting_Algorithms/03.cpp)  
  âž¤ Builds the sorted array one item at a time by inserting elements at their correct positions. Best for small datasets. Time: O(nÂ²)
