# 2. Conditional Statements And Loops

This folder focuses on two core concepts in programming: Conditional Statements and Loops, which are key to controlling the flow of a program. Conditional Statements, such as if, else, and switch, allow the program to make decisions based on certain conditions, enabling dynamic behavior. You'll learn how to implement logic to execute different actions depending on whether a condition is true or false. Loops, including for, while, and do-while, are essential for repeating a block of code multiple times under certain conditions, helping to reduce redundancy and make code more efficient. Mastering these concepts will provide you with the ability to control program execution and iterate over data, which is fundamental for solving complex problems and creating functional software.
