# 2. Conditional Statements and Loops

This folder focuses on two fundamental pillars of programming: **Conditional Statements** and **Loops**, both essential for controlling the flow of a program.

You’ll learn:
- How to make **decisions** in your code using `if`, `else if`, `else`, and `switch` statements.
- How to write **efficient loops** using `for`, `while`, and `do-while` to execute code repeatedly under specific conditions.
- How to simplify conditional logic with the **ternary operator**.

Mastering these concepts enables you to solve complex problems through structured logic, reduce code redundancy, and enhance your code’s efficiency.
