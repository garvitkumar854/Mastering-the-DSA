# 9. Maximum Sub Array Sum

You are given an array of integers which may include positive, negative, or zero values.
Your task is to find the contiguous subarray (a group of elements that are next to each other) which has the maximum sum, and return that sum.

ðŸ§  What is a Subarray?
A **subarray** is a part of the array with consecutive elements.
For example, in `[1, 2, 3, 4]`, valid subarrays include:
- `[1, 2]`
- `[3]`
- `[2, 3, 4]`

ðŸ”’ Constraints:
- Array length â‰¥ 1
- Can include negative numbers
