# 37. 2D Arrays

The **2D Arrays** folder focuses on one of the most useful data structures in programming — arrays arranged in two dimensions (rows and columns). This structure is commonly used in grid-based problems such as game boards, matrices, image representation, and dynamic programming.

In this section, you'll explore:
- **Declaration and Initialization** of 2D arrays and 2D vectors (vector of vectors)
- **Searching** within 2D arrays
- **Iteration techniques** using nested loops
- Differences between static 2D arrays and dynamic 2D vectors

Mastering 2D arrays is essential to efficiently solve problems involving matrices, subgrids, and spatial structures.
