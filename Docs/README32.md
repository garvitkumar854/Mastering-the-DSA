# 32. Strings â€“ Remove All Occurrences of a Substring

## ðŸ§  Problem Statement

You are given two strings:

- `s` â†’ the original string  
- `part` â†’ the substring to remove  

Your task is to **repeatedly remove all occurrences** of `part` from `s` until no more instances are found.

You must return the final resulting string after all removals.

Use `string::find()` and `string::erase()` or simulate it using a loop or stack.
