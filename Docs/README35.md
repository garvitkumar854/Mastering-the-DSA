# 35. Strings â€“ String Compression Problem

## ðŸ§  Problem Statement

You are given a **character array** `chars[]` that represents a string.

Your task is to **compress the string** by replacing **consecutive repeating characters** with the character followed by the count.

The compressed string should be stored **in-place** in the same array.  
Return the new length of the compressed array.

> If a character appears only once, it should remain as is (no count).

## ðŸ“¥ Example

### âœ… Example 1:
```
Input: chars = ['a','a','b','b','c','c','c']
Output: ['a','2','b','2','c','3'] â†’ Length = 6
```

---

## ðŸ“Œ Constraints

- `1 â‰¤ chars.length â‰¤ 2000`  
- All characters are lowercase English letters  
- You must solve it **in-place** with O(1) extra space  
- Time complexity: **O(n)**
